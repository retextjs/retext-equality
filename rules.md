# Rules

## Pattern types

###### Basic

**Basic** patterns highlight possible inconsiderate terms and suggest
potentially more considerate alternatives.

###### Or

**Or** patterns highlight possible inconsiderate terms unless every category is
present.
This is used for gendered work titles and the like, where `garbageman and
garbagewoman` is considered OK, and so is `his or her bike`.
These patterns can be turned into **basic** patterns by passing `noBinary:
true`, thus suggesting two alternatives for `him or her`.

**Or** patterns can be joined by `and`, `or`, or a slash (`/`).

###### And

**And** patterns highlight possible inconsiderate terms if every category is
present.
This is used for one case: `master` and `slave`.

**And** patterns operate on a per-paragraph level.
